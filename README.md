# CabRides-Uber-dataAnalysis
🚕**Cab Ride Analysis - Project Overview**

⬇️⬇️
**In this project**, we analyze cab ride data to uncover key insights into trends, demand fluctuations, and peak times etc.. 
  -By leveraging Python and data analysis techniques, we aim to identify patterns that influence ride experience and availability.

# Objectives:
  - Understand ride pricing variations across different locations and times.
  - Explore factors affecting surge pricing and demand spikes.
  - Analyze customer preferences and travel trends.

# Methodology:
  - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing ride frequency, distance, and fare trends.
  - Statistical Insights: Identifying correlations between time, location, and pricing.

# Technologies Used:
  - Python (Pandas, NumPy)
  - Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  - Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis
---
This project provides valuable insights for both customers and ride-hailing companies by optimizing fare estimations and predicting peak demand times. 🚖📊
